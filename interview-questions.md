# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

4. What is the difference between a function and a method?

  Your answer: A function is a block of code, which is encapsulated, that manipulates data based on input arguments and returns an output. A method is identical to a function, however, the function is stored inside an object. A method is a function stored in an object therefore, a key is assign to the function and the key will be required to invoke the function. In contrast a normal function does not have a key and can be invoked anywhere within the function local scope.
